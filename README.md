The project is a responsive Restaurant Review site :

- For an improved future css experience two new css files have been created for the responsive features of each page.

- Installed imagemin to compress image and move newly created to the "comp" folder.

- Installed gulp-image-resize (with imagemagick & graphicsmagick) to resize the images for the mobile and tablet use.

- Modified js and responsive css to dynamically select the correct image according to user's device.

- A service worker has been installed for off-line view and lie-fi issues.

- Aria have been implemented :
  - Dynamically set alt image attributes
